# Dart FFI Application

### Description

This documentation is created to record the usage of Dart FFI in Flutter applications. This documentation was initially created for personal learning purposes, so there may be some inaccuracies in the approach.

The application to be built is a simple application for calculating Fibonacci and factorial values. The application will generate random numbers using the `Random()` function from Dart. The random value will be assigned to the `num` variable. The calculations for `fibonacci(n)` and `factorial(n)` will be performed using functions created with C++.
